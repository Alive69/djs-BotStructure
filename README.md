# djs-BotStructure
JavaScript is a shitty language, and is only popular because it's used for web development.
Besides Python, a lot of Discord bots are also written in the shittiness that is JavaScript
through an API wrapper called discord.js. I myself am confused by the unnecessary complexity
of the required bot structures just to run your shitty bot, so this is what this repository
is for.

## What this repo has
This repository contains a bot template using discord.js, and all tailored to 
your specific needs, like:

* Commands handler

* Events handler

* Validation (WIP)

That's it really. For now it's simple.

## NPM packages required
`discordjs/rest` - 0.4.1 or higher

`discord-api-types` - 0.33.0 or higher

`discord.js` - 13.7.0 or higher

`dotenv` (optional, not required if you just put the token in the source files) - 16.0.1 or higher

`mongoose` - 6.3.3 or higher
